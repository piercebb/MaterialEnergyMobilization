### Gryffin Experimentation for Thermal Activity Optimization

PROBLEM STATEMENT OVERVIEW
Given a grouping of elemental combinations, which combination provides the greatest capacity for energetic mobilization?

Energy mobilization function gives us the capacity for energetic movement for a combination of elements over a range of temperatures.

Concerns:

- Element’s heat capacity (cP)
- The heat capacity of the elements when combined

We want to use data from 10 different elements
“Categorical” or “Discrete”

Fractional Composition vs T
